# LLM CacheFAQ Accelerator

## Why

Empower your response system with the LLM CacheFAQ Accelerator, leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

The primary goal is to significantly reduce response times for user queries related to a specific document. This practical system utilizes a previously generated Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section based on the document in a JSON format as a dynamic cache.

**Key Features:**

- **Intelligent Knowledge Cache:** The FAQ, generated beforehand, acts as an intelligent knowledge cache.
  
- **Swift Responses:** Leveraging the FAQ as a dynamic cache enables quick adaptation and optimization of responses for user queries towards the document, recognizing similarities and providing efficient and cached responses.

- **Efficient Query Handling:** Replace resource-intensive methods with the optimized FAQ-based approach, offering precomputed responses for frequently asked or similar questions.

- **Dynamic Knowledge Base:** The FAQ dynamically evolves with document changes, ensuring a current and accurate knowledge base.
