# CacheFAQ Accelerator

## Why

This repository addresses the need for a swift and efficient response system by harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). 

The primary goal is to significantly reduce response times when users pose inquiries related to a specific document. Traditional approaches to answering dynamic questions in real-time can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. 

By generating a comprehensive Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section based on the document in a JSON format, this project establishes a knowledge cache.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Rapid Responses:** Utilizing the LLM-generated FAQ as a cache enables the system to swiftly retrieve and adapt responses based on similarities between incoming questions and the pre-existing FAQ entries.
  
- **Efficient Query Handling:** Traditional methods often require extensive processing for each unique query. The FAQ-based approach optimizes this process by offering precomputed responses for frequently asked or similar questions.

- **Dynamic Knowledge Base:** The FAQ is dynamically updated as the document evolves, ensuring that the knowledge base remains current and accurate.

**Overall Impact:**

The implementation of this FAQ-based system aims to revolutionize the way we handle user queries, providing an expedited and resource-efficient solution for diverse and dynamic question-response scenarios.
